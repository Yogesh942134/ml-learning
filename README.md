# ML Learning 📊🤖

Welcome to **ML Learning** — a continuously evolving machine learning learning repository built while I am actively learning Data Science & Machine Learning.

This repository is **not a finished project**.  
It is my personal **learning lab**, where I experiment, practice, break things, rebuild them, and gradually move toward production-level ML understanding.

Everything here is being improved step-by-step as I learn more.

---

## 🧠 Purpose of This Repository

- To document my real ML learning journey  
- To build strong foundations in data handling, preprocessing, and ML modeling  
- To convert raw concepts into hands-on practice  
- To evolve these notebooks into clean pipelines over time  

This repo will be **continuously updated** as my understanding improves.
